## DOPTIME’s Purpose: Reducing Development and Deployment Barriers

	•	doptime is a backend framework deeply optimized for code simplicity, performance, and cost efficiency.  
	•	Using the doptime framework is free.  
	•	The ultimate goal of doptime is to cover common applications’ RPCs, making their costs lower than local calls and profiting through these universal RPCs.

### Simplicity: Combining Wonderful Advantages

The core idea of doptime is to eliminate as much code as possible, making it more user-friendly and highly optimized for AI code generation.
:::

	•	Simplicity: Operate data using only Redis. High concurrency and fast response with simple code.  
	•	Simplicity: When you define a function, it becomes a microservice callable via RPC or HTTP.  
	•	Simplicity: CRUD operations are primarily done with Redis statements, eliminating the need for writing CURD code.  
	•	Simplicity: No distinction between monolithic and microservices. Your code can seamlessly switch from monolithic to microservices.  
	•	Simplicity: No need for code generators or multiple data definitions.  
	•	Simplicity: Focus only on core business code, achieving a state of flow.

### Performance: Maximizing Concurrency and Minimizing Latency

:::

	•	Performance: DragonflyDB can provide over 2M read/write operations per second.  

	•	Performance: Reading and writing local data corresponds to Redis cache latency, significantly outperforming MySQL, with most operations under 1ms.

:::tip Cost

### Minimizing Costs According to Actual Needs

:::

	•	Cost Reduction: Eliminate repetitive development. Many companies offer API interfaces, but using them still involves tedious work.  
doptime aims to compress this repetitive work to nearly nothing.  
Using publicly available open-source RPCs offers higher quality and lower risk.

	•	Cost Reduction: Use low-cost RPCs. The rapid development of AI means the cost of implementing APIs is decreasing exponentially, with their value depreciating rapidly.  
doptime is committed to this depreciation, aiming to lower service fees to the level of single-machine call costs.
In the AI era, cost-effective and reliable APIs will become crucial infrastructure, and they are challenging to localize.  
Using third-party APIs allows users to pay according to actual business needs rather than business expectations, minimizing expenditure and maximizing flexibility.
